## **How the App works**
  
To run this project, first, you should start by having Python installed on your computer. It's advised you create a env to store your project dependencies separately. You can install env with the following command:  
  ```python
    python -m venv env
  ```
if you have multiple versions of python, you can specify them by calling the version
  ```python
    python`version` -m venv env
  ```

then you can activate the env with
  
  ```python
    Linux = source env/bin/activate
    Windows = source env/Scripts/activate
  ```
You need pip to install Python packages, this package will manage and help this project to run. You can install pip with the following command:
  
  ```python
    pip install -r requirements.py
  ```

Or you can install per package. Make sure you are in the right directory, :

- Client :
  - `pwinput`                      
  - `requests`

- Server :
  - `django`
  - `mysqlclient`
  - `wheel (for python version <= 3.7)`

how to install :
```python
  pip install -package name
```
Before accessing a web or cmd application, always make sure the port is running with runserver
  ```python
    python manage.py runserver
  ```
To access the webÂ you can open it on port 8000, click here and do control-c to close the web
  ```python
    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  ```
To access the cmd app, make sure you are in the client directory, then open it with
  ```python
    python client_quiz1r.py
  ```
